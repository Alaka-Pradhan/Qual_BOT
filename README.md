# 💬 Qual-BOT

An AI-powered **Conversational Lead Qualification System** designed for **e-commerce and online businesses** to automatically engage website visitors, understand their intent, and qualify leads based on smart conversation.  
This project aims to help businesses focus on genuine buyers, save time, and improve conversion rates through intelligent automation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern businesses receive hundreds of website inquiries daily, but most lack a smart way to identify serious buyers.  
Sales teams spend valuable hours asking repetitive questions and following up on low-quality leads, while high-intent customers often slip away due to delayed responses.  

Our solution — **Conversational Lead Qualifier** — uses AI-driven chat interactions to:
- Engage visitors naturally
- Ask qualifying questions (budget, requirements, urgency)
- Score leads automatically
- Forward high-value prospects to sales
- Store and analyze conversation data

## 🎯 Problem Statement

E-commerce and service websites struggle to convert visitors into customers because they lack a **smart, real-time lead qualification system**.  
Traditional forms only collect data — they don’t assess buying intent.  
This leads to **time loss, missed opportunities, and lower conversion rates**.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We are building an **AI conversational agent** that:
- Greets website visitors with a friendly, human-like chat
- Collects key info such as needs, budget, and urgency
- Automatically scores leads using an internal logic model
- Schedules meetings or sends follow-up emails for high-value leads
- Stores conversation logs for future improvement and analytics
